- A communication link can be a wired link or wiredless link.
- The link carries the information.
- A computer network is mainly used for resource sharing.
- Identify end devices and intermediary devices.

## Computer Networks - Basic Characteristics

- Fault Tolerance, Scalability, Quality of Service, Security
- Fault Tolerance is the ability to continue working despite failures and to ensure no less of service
- Scalability is the ability to grow based on needs and to have good performance after growth.
- Internet is a scalable network.
- Quality of Service is the ability to set priorities and to manage data trafic to reduce data loss, delay etc.
- Security is the ability to prevent unauthorized access, misuse and forgery.
